====================
...is a development of an existing Discogs Module at Drupal for Drupal 7. important functionality from the current Discogs module is missing. 

INSTALLATION
============
- Install Drupal 7.
- Add modules via ftp. 
- Navigate from Drupal management menu to modules page. Enable modules Discogs (core), feeds fetcher, and 1 other module in Discogs package.
- Go to "import" page  (navigation menu) to try out a few of the API calls. Select an importer. Enter a url  (e.g. examples at Discogs 2.0 help page "http://www.discogs.com/help/api")   in "URL" textfield. Hit import button.
- If import fails. It may be necessary to alter config variable.

TODO
====
- Documentation on architecture
- Count number of "node modules". Recommend user requires only 1 node type enabled 
- Improve UI (alllow logical search terms e,g, name of artist, then wrap in "url request" request before sending request)
- Import search api requests (example at Discogs 2.0 help page) 
- Allow user "map" any Discogs api request to any node type (currently each api request mapped to corresponding node type
- Module with hooks for fields widget/views where that field hold multiple items (unlimited cardinality) e.g. release /tracks, artist/releases and label releases
- Mapper to import data for field holding multiple items. Investigate functionaility of both JSONpath and XMLpath parsers. 
- Extra tables?
